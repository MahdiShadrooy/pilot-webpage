## Theoretical Exercises Evaluation

This course does not follow the conventional paradigm in which students solve assignments independently and submit written solutions for grading.

Instead, theoretical exercises are addressed in structured TA sessions where problems are solved interactively. These sessions emphasize analytical reasoning, conceptual clarity, and mathematical rigor. Teaching assistants evaluate students based on participation, depth of reasoning, and problem-solving quality during these sessions.

Additionally, two short quizzes are administered for each exercise series to assess individual understanding and mastery.
