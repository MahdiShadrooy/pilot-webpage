## Course Overview

Machine learning is fundamentally a statistical discipline concerned with function approximation under uncertainty.

Statistical Machine Learning develops learning as a problem of statistical inference and risk minimization rather than a collection of algorithms. The course emphasizes modeling assumptions, complexity control, and generalization, treating each method as an instance of a unified framework defined by a function class, loss function, and mechanism for controlling overfitting. Ridge regression, Lasso, SVMs, trees, boosting, and neural networks are presented as different answers to the same fundamental question: how can we control complexity to generalize from finite data? The goal is not to apply methods mechanically, but to understand why they should work before using them.

We emphasize principles over software and derivations over recipes.
